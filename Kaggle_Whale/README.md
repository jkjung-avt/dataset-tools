Scripts to prepare training data for a DetectNet "whale head detector" model, based on data from Kaggle's "NOAA Fisheries Right Whale Recognition" competition.

To process the dataset for DetectNet training, run the 3 scripts in the following order:

1. sort_imgs.ipynb
2. hist_train.ipynb
3. prepare_detectnet.ipynb
