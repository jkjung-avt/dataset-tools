# Kaggle_Fisheries

This folder holds scripts for preparing training data for a DetectNet "fish detector" model, based on data from Kaggle's "The Nature Conservancy Fisheries Monitoring" competition.

[https://www.kaggle.com/c/the-nature-conservancy-fisheries-monitoring](https://www.kaggle.com/c/the-nature-conservancy-fisheries-monitoring)

To process the dataset for DetectNet training, run the 2 scripts in the following order:

1. hist_train.ipynb
2. prepare_detectnet.ipynb

You can refer to my blog posts for more detailed description about how I processed this dataset and how I trained a NVIDIA DetectNet model with it.
